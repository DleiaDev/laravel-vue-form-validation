    This application has simple functionality that demonstrates how to use Vue and Laravel together. On the welcome page resides a form which is submited by Vue.js, form data is sent to the server side Laravel script, Laravel preforms validation and responds back to Vue.js, Vue.js accepts the response and displays errors or success message. The goal of this really simple application is to demonstrate synergy between Laravel and Vue using <strong>vForm</strong> package.
